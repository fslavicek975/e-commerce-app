## Introduction

This project is a full-stack e-commerce application built using .NET 7 for the backend and Angular for the frontend.

## Running the project

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need to have the following installed:

- [Docker]
- [.NET SDK v7]
- [Node.js (version 14.20.0 or higher)
- [Git]

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, you need to clone the project into a folder on your computer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fslavicek975/e-commerce-app
cd e-commerce-app
```

### 2. Restore .NET Packages

Restore the required .NET packages by running the following command from the solution folder:

```sh
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Install Angular Dependencies

If you want to run the Angular app in development mode using the Angular dev server, you need to install the Node.js dependencies:

```sh
cd client
npm install
```

### 4. Start PostgreSQL and Redis

The app uses both PostgreSQL and Redis. You can start these services using Docker by running the following command from the solution folder:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

### 5. Run the .NET Application

You can run the .NET application by navigating to the `API` folder and using the following command:

```sh
cd API
dotnet run --launch-profile https
```

You can then browse the application locally at [https://localhost:5001](https://localhost:5001).

### 6. Run the Angular Application in Development Mode

If you wish to run the Angular application in development mode, you will need to install a self-signed SSL certificate. The client app uses an SSL certificate generated by `mkcert`.

#### Install mkcert

To generate the certificate, first install `mkcert` using the instructions provided in its [repository](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).

Once installed, navigate to the `client/ssl` directory and generate the certificate:

```sh
cd client/ssl
mkcert localhost
```

#### Start the Angular Development Server

Now you can run both the .NET app and the Angular app.

- **Terminal Tab 1** - Run the .NET application:

  ```sh
  cd API
  dotnet run --launch-profile https
  ```

- **Terminal Tab 2** - Run the Angular development server:

  ```sh
  ng serve
  ```

You can then browse to the Angular application at [https://localhost:4200](https://localhost:4200).
